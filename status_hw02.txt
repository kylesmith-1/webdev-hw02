and inevitably forget.

6. How many JS tutorial exercises did you do?

About the same, maybe slightly more, 10 or so.

7. How comfortable do you feel with JS now?

Okay, I think I can get around and get stuff working, but I 
still struggle with the idea of what's good design in JS.

8. Do all of your HTML pages pass the W3C HTML validator?
(https://validator.w3.org/)

Yes.

9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?

Broadly, figuring out how to design the calculator well in Javascript.
More narrowly, I found it challenging to get all the operation buttons
working accurately when the + had to function as the = as well.
